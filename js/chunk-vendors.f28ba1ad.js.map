It's still possible to retrieve elements using\r\n         * `document.getElementById('~')` but it needs to be escaped when using\r\n         * `document.querySelector('#\\\\~')` for it to be valid. The only\r\n         * requirements for `id`s are them to be unique on the page and to not be\r\n         * empty (`id=\"\"`). Because of that, when passing an id selector, it should\r\n         * be properly escaped for it to work with `querySelector`. We could check\r\n         * for the id selector to be simple (no CSS combinators `+ >~`) but that\r\n         * would make things inconsistent since they are valid characters for an\r\n         * `id` but would need to be escaped when using `querySelector`, breaking\r\n         * their usage and ending up in no selector returned.
